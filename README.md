# SpaceX Landing Page

## Overview

This project is a dynamic and user-friendly landing page built using React, designed to showcase information about SpaceX rockets and capsules. SpaceX, a prominent aerospace manufacturer and space transportation company, is known for its advanced rocket and spacecraft technology. This landing page leverages SpaceX's open-sourced data, accessible through [SpaceX Data API](https://docs.spacexdata.com/).

## Key Features

- **Visually Stunning Design**: The landing page boasts a modern and visually striking banner layout, highlighting the UI/UX design skills of the developer. The design is pixel-perfect and optimized for various screen sizes and browsers.

- **Advanced Search Functionality**: The search form is equipped with three filters, allowing users to search for capsules based on status, original launch, and type. The search functionality is smooth, bug-free, and optimized for quick results retrieval.

- **Responsive Design**: The landing page is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes. The use of Semantic HTML and adherence to SEO best practices contribute to its accessibility and search engine visibility.

- **Elegant Data Grid**: The data grid section presents information in an elegant and organized manner. Data is paginated, with ten items displayed per page. Users can click on an item to view detailed information in a popup, enhancing user engagement.

- **Optimized Queries**: To ensure fast loading times, optimized queries have been implemented, resulting in a snappy user experience.

- **Quality Code**: The project adheres to clean coding practices, producing a codebase free from ESLint and PHPCS issues. While not mandatory, the inclusion of test cases further enhances the project's quality.

- The `public` directory contains the main `index.html` file, which serves as the entry point for the application.

- The `src` directory contains the React components, styles, and the main `index.js` file.

- The `components` directory houses the reusable React components used in the application. You can modify and create new components in this directory.
- The `pages` directory houses the main page design containing required reusable component .

- The `main.jsx` file is the entry point for the React application. You can modify this file to add or remove components and configure routing, if necessary.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server and opens the application in your default browser.

- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production. The optimized and minified files will be generated in the `dist` directory.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
